# h8mail 2.3 features

#### Search Operators Summary

|            | username | domain | hash | password |       ip       |
|------------|:--------:|:------:|:----:|:--------:|:--------------:|
| WeLeakInfo |    yes   |   yes  |  yes |    yes   |    yes    |
| LeakLookup |    yes   |   yes  |      |    yes   | yes  |
| Snusbase   |    yes   |        |  yes |    yes   |  yes   |


## Generate a blank configuration file

You can now generate a blank configuration file to add your API keys. It will have all available fields commented using `;`.  
Simply use `--gen-config` or `-g`. It will generate a configuration file called `h8mail_config.ini` in the current working directory & exit.

Be careful as it will overwrite existing `h8mail_config.ini` file.
To remove a comment, remove the `;` at the beginning of the file.


## HaveIBeenPwned v3

Troy Hunt [has announced](https://www.troyhunt.com/authentication-and-the-have-i-been-pwned-api/) that starting on the 18/08/2019, HIBP will only support authenticated requests.

You can purchase your API key [here](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/Key?ref=h8mail).

Once you have your API key, add it to the `hibp` line, and uncomment the line.

Pass the configuration file using `-c h8mail_config.ini`

h8mail will be relying on emailrep.io's free API to identify breaches for emails.

## Debug output

To dump incoming and outgoing requests, simply add `--debug` to your command.

## New search queries

This was probably the most requested feature since h8mail v2 release. View the table to see which provider supports what.  
You can now use the following keywords with `-q` to tell h8mail what to query:  
* `username`
* `password`
* `ip`
* `hash`
* `domain`

Typically:

* to search for all breaches for the username bob.smith:
```
$ h8mail -t bob.smith -q username -c h8mail_config.ini
```

* to search for all breaches for the ip 80.90.100.110, output to CSV:
```
$ h8mail -t 80.90.100.110 -q ip -c h8mail_config.ini -o results.csv
```

*(links contain refs)*  
You can purchase API keys for:  
- [Snusbase](https://snusbase.com/?ref=h8mail)
- [WeLeakInfo](https://weleakinfo.com/?ref=h8mail)
- [Leak-Lookup](https://leak-lookup.com/?ref=h8mail)

## Power-chasing

Since h8mail now supports broader queries (such as `domain`) you can use breach services to add related emails to target, instead of relying on `hunter.io` only.  

This is activated by adding `--power-chase` to a chasing h8mail command:

```
$ h8mail -t evilcorp.com -q domain -c h8mail_config.ini -ch 2 --power-chase
```
