# ðŸŒˆ **h8mail v2 has just been released** 

New features have been added to better hunt down passwords.  

In the following write-up, we'll be covering h8mail's options with examples and use-cases. At the end of this page, you'll hopefully be bringing passwords back like a necromancer ðŸ’€

# Installing

h8mail is now distributed using `pip`, which is a Python package manager. This article won't go into details on how to configure python for your environment. To start you should at least:  

* Have Python3.6+ installed
* Be able to call python in your terminal

## Python
We'll review some common installation patterns below:  
Having both Python 2 and 3 installed is common. You can check the default Python version by running:  

```bash
$ python --version
```

If it says `Python 2.x`, and have installed Python 3.6+, chances are you can just run:

```bash
$ python3 --version
```

This is typically the case for OSX, Kali Linux, and older Linux distributions.
In the following instructions, remember to replace `python` with `python3` if that's your case.


## Using `pip` to install h8mail

To install h8mail using `pip`, simply use:
```bash
$ pip install h8mail
```

If you have not set your venvs, you might get a permission error saying `Consider using the --user option or check the permissions`.  
Simply add `--user` like so:
```bash
$ pip install --user h8mail
```
* Illustrated installation:

### Getting `pip`
This write-up assumes you have a Python environment correctly configured.  
Here are some tips if you run into trouble.  
Once your `python` command working, you need to have `pip` installed. It probably shipped with your Python installation.  
To check, simply type:

```bash
$ pip -h
$ pip3 -h
```

If that's not the case, you can use an integrated Python module to install `pip` like so:

```bash
$ python -m ensurepip
$ pip -h
```

This should take care of fetching, installing and linking `pip`.  
If installation was successful and still having issues invoking `pip`, you can try running it as a module:  

```bash
$ python -m pip -h
```


# Local Searching

One of h8mail's new feature is the local search. You can use compressed `.gz` files or uncompressed `.txt` files.  


### Working with compressed or cleartext breaches

Arguments can be passed loosely, such as:  

```bash
$ h8mail -t targets.txt -gz ./Leaks/2019-*
```
```bash
$ h8mail -t john@gmail.com -gz . ../Collection1/ ../Collection2/EU_* -lb /tmp/combolists/2019-* /tmp/dumps/leak.txt -o output.csv
```

If you wish to keep you search local, you can use `-sk` or `--skip` to skip online checks.


By default, h8mail will use multiprocessing, one "worker" for each file. This means h8mail will search multiple files at the same time. One "worker" will be spawned for each core your CPU has.

The local search can be combined with other h8mail features, such as HIBP, API services or regrouped results.

(I had to compress the last GIF to make it fit, which is fitting don't you think...)


### *Loose* search and inputs


Another one of h8mail's new features is the ability to perform *loose* searching, which is basically bypassing the pattern recognition.  
By default, h8mail looks for email patterns. This means you can pass raw files as targets, h8mail will look for emails and automatically add them to targets.


```bash
$ h8mail -t admins-list-page.html -lb /tmp/combos.txt
```

Since h8mail supports globing, you could even do something like this:  
```bash
$ h8mail -t /crawled-html/*.html -gz ../Collection1/
```
APIs don't support this, so be sure to skip online checks. This can be useful when looking for a domain, or patterns of usernames inside local files.

```bash
$ h8mail --loose --skip -t "evilcorp.com" -gz ../Collection1/
$ h8mail --loose --skip -t "john.smith" "jsmith" -gz ../Collection1/
```

Or even recurring password:  
```bash
$ h8mail --loose --skip -t "JSm1th99" -gz ../Collection1/
```

### Single file mode

To avoid loosing performance, data is not passed between processes while performing a local search. This also means that h8mail will not output a precise lookup progress bar.  
If you wish to disable multiprocessing to get a more verbose live lookup status, use the `-sf` or `--single-file` option, like so:  
```bash
$ h8mail -t targets.txt -lb /tmp/combolists/ -sf -sk
```

### Breach Compilation

This feature was already part of h8mail's first version, and has been reintegrated. Since this breach is amongst the most shared, I think it's okay to reference a link in this write-up. h8mail uses the `query.sh` script that is included in the torrent, meaning this will **only work on Linux & OSX** platforms. Windows users can still use the generic `-lb` on the data.

h8mail was built using the Breach Compilation version referenced [here](https://gist.github.com/scottlinux/9a3b11257ac575e4f71de811322ce6b3#gistcomment-2298792)

To use this option, simply point the `-bc` argument to the downloaded BreachCompilation folder.

```bash
$ h8mail -t test@evilcorp.com -bc ./BreachedCompilation/ -sk
```

# Chasing

Another one of h8mail's new feature is the ability to target related emails using hunter.io. This is referred as *chasing*.  
You can use the chasing feature with a [free hunter.io AI key](https://hunter.io/api).

```bash
$ h8mail -t admin@evilcorp.com -ch 10 -c config.ini
```

The `-ch` or `--chase` option needs the number of email per target to *chase*, as well as the API key for hunter.io.

You can chain usage of the *chasing* feature with API and local search, making it very powerful feature when targeting an organization.  

I might add search depths in a future version (launch a new *chase* with found related emails), but also considering nerfing it.

# Finding and downloading breaches

Without giving away all the keys, I'll add a few tips for those getting started.  
First, data breaches are **big**. You'll quickly want to learn how to use seedboxes and work remotely. Docker is great for this too.  

In regards to where to find them, you can get the BreachCompilation torrent referenced earlier. You can also look into specialized communities, such as raidforums, [link-base.org](https://link-base.org), or direct download them from [databases.today](https://databases.today/).  
This should be plenty enough to get you started.

# Coming up next

In the next write-ups, we're going to look at using h8mail with API services, such as [Snusbase](https://snusbase.com/) and [Leak-lookup](https://leak-lookup.com/).

We'll also look at some additional features, such as `--hide` for demonstrations, combining h8mail with Docker to download torrents super fast, even maybe using [WhatBreach](https://github.com/Ekultek/WhatBreach) with h8mail.

I think I'll close the write-up here.  

If you create content based on h8mail (blog, video..) feel free to let me know, I'll add it to the homepage if its relevant.



Finally, be nice, use your powers to help others. And show support for your open-source developers :)   
Thank you for reading!
